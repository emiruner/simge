A very thin, mostly 2D wrapper for glut and simple
geometric structures.

To compile CMake must be installed.

After compilation you need to copy the include/simge
directory to a known location. And copy the resulting
*.a (*.lib) files to a known location or
if it is a linux system run "make install" in the 
cmake build directory.

The geom package can be used without compiling
as it is a pure template library.
